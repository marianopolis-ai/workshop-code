# Workshop 4
In this workshop, we cover Pandas, ScikitLearn (linear regression to be more precise) and use it on WHO's Life Expectancy dataset available here.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

For simplicity, we also downloaded the dataset here, so you don't need to dowload Kaggle and all that.
