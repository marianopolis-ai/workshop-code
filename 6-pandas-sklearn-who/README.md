# Workshop 4
In this workshop, we cover Pandas, ScikitLearn (linear regression to be more precise) and use it on WHO's Life Expectancy dataset available here.

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who

For simplicity, we also downloaded the dataset here, so you don't need to dowload Kaggle and all that by using this link instead
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marianopolis-ai/workshop-code/master/4-pandas-sklearn-who/life_expectancy_data.csv

If you want to use it in Python and Pandas, do
```py
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marianopolis-ai/workshop-code/master/4-pandas-sklearn-who/life_expectancy_data.csv")
```
