# Workshop #7: Classification of SHROOMS!
In this workshop, we're going to cover categorical features and classification tasks for machine learning!

We're using a funny or *shroomy* dataset *(drum roll please)*: the **SHROOM** dataset!

The dataset link is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/mushroom-classification

## What we're covering
- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Classification models (Random Forest/SVC/Naive Bayes/Linear Discriminmant Analysis)
- Target Encoding and Label Encoding
  
To import the csv in code, you can use 
```py
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marianopolis-ai/workshop-code/master/7-pandas-sklearn-shroom/mushrooms.csv")
```
